    /// Represent a moment in time.

    /// AVAudioTime is used in AVAudioEngine to represent time. Instances are immutable.
    ///
    /// A single moment in time may be represented in two different ways:
    /// 1. mach_absolute_time(), the system's basic clock. Commonly referred to as "host time."
    /// 2. audio samples at a particular sample rate
    ///
    /// A single AVAudioTime instance may contain either or both representations; it might
    /// represent only a sample time, only a host time, or both.
    ///
    /// Rationale for using host time:
    /// [a] internally we are using AudioTimeStamp, which uses host time, and it seems silly to divide
    /// [b] it is consistent with a standard system timing service
    /// [c] we do provide conveniences to convert between host ticks and seconds (host time divided by
    /// frequency) so client code wanting to do what should be straightforward time computations can at
    /// least not be cluttered by ugly multiplications and divisions by the host clock frequency.
    ///
