    /// This is not a formal protocol by choice.  The reason for that is that there are three ways to receive events here. An input method should choose one of those ways and  implement the appropriate methods.
    ///
    /// Here are the three approaches:
    ///
    /// 1.  Support keybinding.
    /// In this approach the system takes each keydown and trys to map the keydown to an action method that the input method has implemented.  If an action is found the system calls didCommandBySelector:client:.  If no action method is found inputText:client: is called.  An input method choosing this approach should implement
    /// -(BOOL)inputText:(NSString*)string client:(id)sender;
    /// -(BOOL)didCommandBySelector:(SEL)aSelector client:(id)sender;
    ///
    /// 2. Receive all key events without the keybinding, but do "unpack" the relevant text data.
    /// Key events are broken down into the Unicodes, the key code that generated them, and modifier flags.  This data is then sent to the input method's inputText:key:modifiers:client: method.  For this approach implement:
    /// -(BOOL)inputText:(NSString*)string key:(NSInteger)keyCode modifiers:(NSUInteger)flags client:(id)sender;
    ///

It is called to process a command that was generated by user action such as typing certain keys or mousing down. It is necessary for this method to return YES or NO so the  event can be passed through to the client if it is not handled.  The selector can be an action specified in the input method's dictionary of keys and actions (i.e. an action specific to the input method) or one of the NSResponder action methods such as insertNewline: or deleteBackward:.
