To communicate to the AVCaptionRenderer client the minimal set of time ranges where there are any visual differences, AVCaptionRendererScenes can be requested from -[AVCaptionRenderer captionSceneChangesInRange:]. A client wanting to optimize drawing performance may use this timing information to draw scenes only once per scene. Alternatively, clients can ignore scenes and repeatedly call renderInContext:atTime: but this may have additional performance impact.

Even a single caption with internal animations in part of its duration could result in multiple AVCaptionRendererScenes being produced.
