Note that this functionality is intended for applications supporting professional video workflows. It is not recommended for network-facing applications such as web browsers, messaging clients, mail clients, etc. By convention, format readers registered using this function should conform to the abstract UTType of "com.apple.mediaextension-content" which in turn conforms to the abstract type "public.movie". Clients can use the type "com.apple.mediaextension-content" to do type filtering (e.g. in Open... dialogs).
